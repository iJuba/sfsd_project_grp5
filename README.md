### student manager program

Welcome to the our student manager program projetc  repository! 🎉
This repository is designed to provide beginners with the fundamental concepts and hands-on experience needed to start programming with Python.

## Projetc Overview

   ## 📋 Features
### Student Management:
1.Add students with details (name, birth year, class, grades, etc.).

2.Search for a student using their unique registration number.

3.Update student information with automatic recalculation of weighted averages.

4.Logical deletion of students (mark as "deleted" without physical removal).

### Class Data Management:

 . Extract and display students of a specific class, sorted by their weighted average in descending order.
  
### File Organization:

 . Periodic reorganization to physically remove logically deleted records and optimize file storage.

### Data Validation:

  . Ensure data consistency (e.g., birth years between 1990–2020, grades between 0–20).

  
  ## ⚙️ Technical Details

Data stored in a structured binary file with the following format:

  Registration number, name, birth year, class, grades, average, deletion indicator.

Weighted averages are calculated using coefficients for four core modules:

SFSD (4), POO (3), Analyse Mathématique (2), Algèbre Linéaire (5).

Interactive menu for user-friendly navigation and functionality selection.
