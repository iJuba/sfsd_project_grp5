### student manager program

Welcome to the our student manager program projetc  repository! üéâ
This repository is designed to provide beginners with the fundamental concepts and hands-on experience needed to start programming with Python.

## Projetc Overview

   ## üìã Features

  ## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

Data stored in a structured binary file with the following format:

Registration number, name, birth year, class, grades, average, deletion indicator.

Weighted averages are calculated using coefficients for four core modules:

SFSD (4), POO (3), Analyse Math√©matique (2), Alg√®bre Lin√©aire (5).

Interactive menu for user-friendly navigation and functionality selection.


   
### Student Management: made by the following operations\functions  : 

1.Add students with details (name, birth year, class, grades, etc.) 
 
2.Search for a student using their unique registration number.

3.Update student information with automatic recalculation of weighted averages .

4.Logical deletion of students (mark as "deleted" without physical removal).

5. extrating a class of students and displaying them
    
6.physical delete of student records .

7. keeping the order of the students (using regetration number) for more efficiancy in search and other operations
   



### Class Data Management:

 . Extract and display students of a specific class, sorted by their weighted average in descending order.
  
### File Organization:

 . Periodic reorganization to physically remove logically deleted records and optimize file storage.

### Data Validation:

  . Ensure data consistency (e.g., birth years between 1990‚Äì2020, grades between 0‚Äì20).
